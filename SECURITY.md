# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities in our project seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it by sending an email to [security@ethandavies.co.uk](mailto:security@ethandavies.co.uk). Please do not create GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Include the following details in your email:

-   Description of the vulnerability
-   Steps to reproduce or proof of concept (if possible)
-   Versions affected

Once the report is received, we will:

-   Confirm the vulnerability and its impact
-   Acknowledge receipt of your report
-   Work on a fix and coordinate a release date (if necessary)
-   Provide credit to the reporter (if desired)

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. This means:

-   Providing reasonable time for us to address the issue before disclosing it publicly
-   Avoiding automated scans and testing methods that could harm the stability or security of our services

We commit to:

-   Responding promptly to your report
-   Keeping you informed of our progress
-   Notifying you when the vulnerability is fixed

Thank you for helping to keep our project safe and secure for everyone.
